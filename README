Mantis is the data-acquisition software for the Project 8 collaboration.

It is currently designed to record data taken from a Signatec PX1500 digitizer.

Mantis requires the PX1500 driver software, and the Monarch library.
The latter is available at https://github.com/project8/monarch.

Mantis is installed using CMake (version 2.8 or better).
We recommend an out-of-source build:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    
To configure the installation you can use cmake, ccmake, or cmake-gui, and you must
specify the location of the Monarch configuration file (usually MonarchConfig.cmake) 
relative to the build directory:
    cmake -DMONARCH_CONFIG=../../path/to/MonarchConfig.cmake ..

To build and install:
    make
    make install
    
The install prefix is specified by the CMake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
The library, binaries, and header files will be installed in the 
lib, bin, and include subdirectories. The default install prefix is the
build directory.
