Purpose
=======

This page is intended to be a repository for random bits of information that need to be remembered, 
but don't necessarily have a good alternative home.

Please try to keep it organized.

Using Mantis
============

* In the server config, `completed-file-key` is used to specify the routing key for sending an alert about each file completed; this can be turned off by making this an empty string.


Developing Mantis
=================

* Block size = record size * # of channels
